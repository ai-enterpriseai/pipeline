# Performance Improvement Roadmap

This document tracks all tasks related to improving pipeline speed and latency. Each task is stored in a separate file within this directory.

## Task List

| ID  | File                                   | Status  | Description                                |
|----|----------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
|001 | 001-plan-performance-analysis.md       | In Progress | Analyze current pipeline performance       |
|002 | 002-plan-async-loading.md              | Planned | Implement asynchronous file loading        |
|003 | 003-plan-embedding-batching.md         | Planned | Batch embeddings across documents          |
|004 | 004-plan-db-upload-optimization.md     | Planned | Optimize database upload strategy          |
|005 | 005-plan-profiling.md                  | Planned | Create profiling and benchmarking scripts  |

## Key Decisions
- Focus initially on profiling to understand baseline performance (Plan 001).
- Subsequent tasks build on insights from the analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Additional tasks may be added as profiling reveals new bottlenecks.
